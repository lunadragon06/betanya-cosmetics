# 💄 Semester Project 2 - Betanya Cosmetics
<img src="/assets/homepage.png" alt="Alt text">

## 📜 Description
**Betanya Cosmetics (BC)** is a micro ecommerce website with a vision to display vegan makeup products for people who want to buy and use pure, cruelty-free cosmetics. The goal of this assignment was to use everything I learned and could so far in vanilla JavaScript from the 3rd semester (2nd year) of the Frontend Development study program at Noroff Vocatinal School. Due to covid which I got at the same time as this exam took place, where I also struggled with long COVID during and after this semester project, is therefore presented deficient. Errors on page from admin side will be attempted to be fixed again and other functionalities will be added to this site when time permits me to do these.
<br><br>
Live site to this project is currently unavailable as this project will still be ongoing after Portfolio marking, and will be used as practice project.
### Users can 👤
- [x] Find vegan makeup products from homepage 
### While admin can ⚙️
- [x] Add new makeup product
- [x] Update makeup products by ... 
+ edit each individual product properties
+ delete a single product from both site and API 
- [ ] New functionalities and improvements for admin and especially users will most likely be added
