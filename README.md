# 💄 Semester Project 2 - Betanya Cosmetics
<img src="/assets/homepage.png" alt="Alt text">

## 📜 Description
**Betanya Cosmetics (BC)** is a micro ecommerce website with a vision to display vegan makeup products for people who want to buy and use pure, cruelty-free cosmetics. The goal of this assignment was to use everything I learned and could so far in vanilla JavaScript from the 3rd semester (2nd year) of the Frontend Development study program at Noroff Vocatinal School. Due to covid which I got at the same time as this exam took place, where I also struggled with long COVID during and after this semester project, is therefore presented deficient. Errors on page from admin side will be attempted to be fixed again and other functionalities will be added to this site when time permits me to do these.
<br><br>
Live site to this project is currently unavailable as this project will still be ongoing after Portfolio marking, and will be used as practice project.
### In this project we can 🔍
- [x] Find vegan makeup products from homepage 
### While admin can ⚙️
- [x] Add new makeup product
- [x] Update makeup products by ... 
+ edit each individual product properties
+ delete a single product from both site and API 
- [ ] New functionalities and improvements for admin and especially users will most likely be added 
#### Login info 🔐
The login information is exactly the same as for Project Exam 2 (Torf's Gallery of Art) which has been provided from my other GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/lunadragon06/torfs-art-gallery/tree/master). Same base API url was used, since I currently don't have energy nor capacity to make new publicly hosted.  
## 🔧 Built With
I used these following tech stack to build this project:
- [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) 
## 🚀 Getting Started
### How to view this project successfully ✨
``Download ZIP`` directly from this repo by clicking on the green ``<> Code`` button, or clone the repo by typing this command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunadragon06/betanya-cosmetics.git
```
### Run the website 💻
It is recommended that this site is opened and viewed from VSC (Visual Studio Code) or other code editor program of your choice (for free) from your computer by opening ``index.html`` file and then clicking on ``Go Live`` button/link that should be located somewhere at the bottom right corner of the program. In this way we can ensure that the site will be able to run. 
<br><br>
If ``Go Live`` doesn't exsist, ``Live Server`` should be installed and then restart code editor before we can get the most out of previewing site.

## 🏅 License
This is a redesign and attempted improved version of [this semester project repo](https://github.com/LunaDragon666/sp-2/) of mine from my other GitHub account(where the used API link doesn't exsist anymore), which I didn't manage to finish for Portfolio 2 submission on time in this case.
